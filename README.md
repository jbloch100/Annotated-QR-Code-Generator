Damaged Cart QR Code Generator 

Overview 

  This repository contains sample code for creating a QR code that redirects to the Dragonfly website, specifically for use within the Amazon A to Z application. The code demonstrates how to generate a QR code that, when scanned, will direct users to report a damaged cart. 

Features 
  
  - QR code generation targeting the specific Dragonfly URL.
  - Custom text annotation to label the QR code as "Damaged Cart."
  - Easy integration with the Amazon A to Z app.

Prerequisites 

  - Python 3.x
  - Pillow library
  - qrcode library

Installation 

  To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary Python libraries: 
    - git clone https://github.com/jbloch100/Annotated-QR-Code-Generator.git
    - pip install pillow qrcode

Usage

  The generate_qr.py script is a straightforward example of how to create a QR code for reporting damaged carts. Run the script, and it will generate an image file with the QR code.
